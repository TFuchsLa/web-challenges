// There is, however, a warning regarding the `key` prop in list items. This happens becaus newly added items currently don't have an `id` to be used by the `./src/components/List/index.jsx` component. There is a package called `uid` already installed to fix this.

// - In your `App`, import `uid` via `import { uid } from "uid";`.
// - A new animal is added inside of the `handleAddAnimal` function, which is where you need to add the id.
// - When `setAnimals` is called, replace the `newAnimal` part with a new object.
// - Spread `newAnimal` into this object and add the id key with `id: uid()`. It might look similar to this:
//   - `setXzys([...xyzs, {id: uid(), ...newXyz}]);`
